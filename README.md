# Mnemonic Seed to Stenography

Encrypt and convert your mnemonic seed into a stenographic image. A new standard for mainstream Bitcoin storage.

Implement this new standard into any existing crypto wallet that supports mnemonic seeds. Instead of getting a user to write down 12 or 24 words, export a stenographic image.
